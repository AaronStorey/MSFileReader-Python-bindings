# MSFileReader_Python_bindings

Thermo MSFileReader is a C++ dynamic-link library (.dll) made available by ThermoFisher Scientific (on https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/product?plneID=632401) to interact with .raw files generated by their range of tandem mass spectrometers.

Here I make available my Python bindings for the version 3.0SP2 (August 2014) and 3.0SP3 (April 2015), both versions have been tested.
53 / 174 functions have been binded (cf. DONE flag) and 20 / 174 have been considered redundant with already binded functions (cf. USELESS flag).

NOTE: The function IsQExactive only works in the version 3.0SP3.

NOTE: The official documentation seems more up-to-date in the 3.0SP2 version than in the 3.0SP3 version...


The bindings are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4, they require the comtypes library available on http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ for Python 2.x and 3.x. The bindings require that you have installed previously the appropriate Thermo MSFileReader version depending of your Python version (32bits or 64bits) so that the .dll is registered to the Windows COM server.
