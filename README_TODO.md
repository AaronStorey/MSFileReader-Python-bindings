# MSFileReader_Python_bindings

Thermo MSFileReader is a C++ dynamic-link library (.dll) made available by ThermoFisher Scientific (on https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/product?plneID=632401) to interact with .raw files generated by their range of tandem mass spectrometers.

Here I make available my Python bindings for the version 3.0SP2 (August 2014) of this library, and has been tested too on the newer version 3.0SP3 (April 2015).

The bindings are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4, they require the comtypes library available on http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ for Python 2.x and 3.x. The bindings require that you have installed previously the appropriate Thermo MSFileReader version depending of your Python version (32bits or 64bits) so that the .dll is registered to the Windows COM server.

Most of the functions have been binded, in particular these for extracting XIC. In more details :
